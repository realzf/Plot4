# Project Title

## Description
This project is Connect4. In this game there are 2 players, Player R (Red) and Player Y (Yellow) and it is played on a 6x7 Grid. Player R goes first, and players will then alternate turns. You drop your checker (either 'R' or 'Y) into a column and your goal is to get 4 checkers of your colour in a row. If you are the first player to get four in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally), you win the game.
